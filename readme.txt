See which plugins are slowing down your site.  This plugin creates a performance
report for your site.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a profile of your WordPress site's plugin's performance by
measuring their impact on your site's load time.  Often times, WordPress sites
load slowly because of poorly configured plugins or because there are so many of
them. By using the P3 plugin, you can narrow down anything causing slowness on
your site.

directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from
Plugins page.
